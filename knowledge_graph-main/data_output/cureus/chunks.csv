"Article 51
Classification of general-purpose AI models as general-purpose AI models with systemic risk"|json|5.1.1|5.1.1|Unknown|Unknown|Unknown
"1. A general-purpose AI model shall be classified as a general-purpose AI model with 
systemic risk if it meets any of the following requirements: (a) it has high impact capabilities evaluated on the basis of appropriate technical tools 
and methodologies, including indicators and benchmarks; (b) based on a decision of the Commission, ex officio or following a qualified alert 
from the scientific panel, it has capabilities or an impact equivalent to those set out 
in point (a) having regard to the criteria set out in Annex XIII."|json|5.1.2|5.1.2|Unknown|Unknown|Unknown
"2. A general-purpose AI model shall be presumed to have high impact capabilities 
pursuant to paragraph 1, point (a), when the cumulative amount of computation used 
for its training measured in FLOPs is greater than 10^25."|json|5.1.3|5.1.3|Unknown|Unknown|Unknown
"3. The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 97 to amend the 
thresholds listed in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, as well as to supplement 
benchmarks and indicators in light of evolving technological developments, such as 
algorithmic improvements or increased hardware efficiency, when necessary, for these 
thresholds to reflect the state of the art."|json|5.1.4|5.1.4|Unknown|Unknown|Unknown

Procedure"|json|5.2.1|5.2.1|Unknown|Unknown|Unknown
"1. Where a general-purpose AI model meets the requirement referred to in Article 51(1), 
point (a), the relevant provider shall notify the Commission without delay and in any 
event within two weeks after that requirement is met or it becomes known that it will be 
met. That notification shall include the information necessary to demonstrate that the 
relevant requirement has been met. If the Commission becomes aware of a general-
purpose AI model presenting systemic risks of which it has not been notified, it may 
decide to designate it as a model with systemic risk."|json|5.2.2|5.2.2|Unknown|Unknown|Unknown
"2. The provider of a general purpose AI model that meets the requirement referred to in 
Article 51(1), point (a), may present, with its notification, sufficiently substantiated 
arguments to demonstrate that, exceptionally, although it meets that requirement, the 
general purpose AI model does not present, due to its specific characteristics, systemic 
risks and therefore should not be classified as a general-purpose AI model with systemic 
risk."|json|5.2.3|5.2.3|Unknown|Unknown|Unknown
"3. Where the Commission concludes that the arguments submitted pursuant to paragraph 2 
are not sufficiently substantiated and the relevant provider was not able to demonstrate 
that the general-purpose AI model does not present, due to its specific characteristics, 
systemic risks, it shall reject those arguments, and the general-purpose AI model shall be 
considered to be a general-purpose AI model with systemic risk."|json|5.2.4|5.2.4|Unknown|Unknown|Unknown
"4. The Commission may designate a general-purpose AI model as presenting systemic 
risks, ex officio or following a qualified alert from the scientific panel pursuant to 
Article 90(1), point (a), on the basis of criteria set out in Annex XIII. 
The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 97 to specify and 
update the criteria set out in Annex XIII."|json|5.2.5|5.2.5|Unknown|Unknown|Unknown
"5. Upon a reasoned request of a provider whose model has been designated as a general-
purpose AI model with systemic risk pursuant to paragraph 4, the Commission shall take 
the request into account and may decide to reassess whether the general-purpose AI 
model can still be considered to present systemic risks on the basis of the criteria set out 
in Annex XIII. Such request shall contain objective, detailed and new reasons that have 
arisen since the designation decision. Providers may request reassessment at the earliest 
six months after the designation decision. Where the Commission, following its 
reassessment, decides to maintain the designation as a general-purpose AI model with 
systemic risk, providers may request reassessment at the earliest six months after that 
decision."|json|5.2.6|5.2.6|Unknown|Unknown|Unknown
"6. The Commission shall ensure that a list of general-purpose AI models with systemic risk 
is published and shall keep that list up to date, without prejudice to the need to observe 
and protect intellectual property rights and confidential business information or trade 
secrets in accordance with Union and national law.
