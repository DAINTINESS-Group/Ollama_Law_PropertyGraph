The \nnotification shall, as a minimum, contain the information specified under paragraph 6 \nand shall not include sensitive operational data.\n5. A Member State may decide to provide for the possibility to fully or partially authorise the \nuse of ‘real-time’ remote biometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for \nthe purposes of law enforcement within the limits and under the conditions listed in \nparagraph 1, point (h), and paragraphs 2 and 3.  Member States concerned shall lay \ndown in their national law the necessary detailed rules for the request, issuance and \nexercise of, as well as supervision and reporting relating to, the authorisations referred to \nin paragraph 3. Those rules shall also specify in respect of which of the objectives listed in \nparagraph 1, point (h), including which of the criminal offences referred to in point (h)(iii) \nthereof, the competent authorities may be authorised to use those systems for the purposes \nof law enforcement. Member States shall notify those rules to the Commission at the \nlatest 30 days following the adoption thereof. Member States may introduce, in \naccordance with Union law, more restrictive laws on the use of remote biometric \nidentification systems.\n6. National market surveillance authorities and the national data protection authorities of \nMember States that have been notified of the use of ‘real-time’ remote biometric \nidentification systems in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes \npursuant to paragraph 4 shall submit to the Commission annual reports on such use. \nFor that purpose, the Commission shall provide Member States and national market \nsurveillance and data protection authorities with a template, including information on \nthe number of the decisions taken by competent judicial authorities or an independent \nadministrative authority whose decision is binding upon requests for authorisations in \naccordance with paragraph 3 and their result.\n7. The Commission shall publish annual reports on the use of real-time remote biometric \nidentification systems in publicly accessible spaces for law enforcement purposes, based \non aggregated data in Member States on the basis of the annual reports referred to in \nparagraph 6. Those annual reports shall not include sensitive operational data of the \nrelated law enforcement activities.\n8. This Article shall not affect the prohibitions that apply where an AI practice infringes \nother Union law.\nHigh-risk ai systems\r\n\nClassification rules for high-risk ai systems\n\nArticle 6\nClassification rules for high-risk AI systems\n1. Irrespective of whether an AI system is placed on the market or put into service \nindependently from the products referred to in points (a) and (b), that AI system shall be \nconsidered to be high-risk where both of the following conditions are fulfilled:\n(a) the AI system is intended to be used as a safety component of a product, or the AI \nsystem is itself a product, covered by the Union harmonisation legislation listed in \nAnnex I;\n(b) the product whose safety component pursuant to point (a) is the AI system, or the \nAI system itself as a product, is required to undergo a third-party conformity \nassessment, with a view to the placing on the market or the putting into service of \nthat product pursuant to the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex I.\n2. In addition to the high-risk AI systems referred to in paragraph 1, AI systems referred to in \nAnnex III shall be considered to be high-risk.\n3. By derogation from paragraph 2, an AI system shall not be considered to be high-risk if \nit does not pose a significant risk of harm to the health, safety or fundamental rights of \nnatural persons, including by not materially influencing the outcome of decision \nmaking. This shall be the case where one or more of the following conditions are \nfulfilled:\n(a) the AI system is intended to perform a narrow procedural task;\n(b) the AI system is intended to improve the result of a previously completed human \nactivity;\n(c) the AI system is intended to detect decision-making patterns or deviations from \nprior decision-making patterns and is not meant to replace or influence the \npreviously completed human assessment, without proper human review; or\n(d) the AI system is intended to perform a preparatory task to an assessment relevant \nfor the purposes of the use cases listed in Annex III.\nNotwithstanding the first subparagraph, an AI system referred to in Annex III shall \nalways be considered to be high-risk where the AI system performs profiling of natural \npersons.\n4. A provider who considers that an AI system referred to in Annex III is not high-risk \nshall document its assessment before that system is placed on the market or put into \nservice. Such provider shall be subject to the registration obligation set out in \nArticle 49(2). Upon request of national competent authorities, the provider shall provide \nthe documentation of the assessment.\n5. The Commission shall, after consulting the European Artificial Intelligence Board (the \n‘Board’), and no later than … [18 months from the date of entry into force of this \nRegulation], provide guidelines specifying the practical implementation of this Article in \nline with Article 96 together with a comprehensive list of practical examples of use cases \nof AI systems that are high-risk and not high-risk.\n6. The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 97 to amend the \nconditions laid down in paragraph 3, first subparagraph, of this Article.\nThe Commission may adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 97 in order to add \nnew conditions to those laid down in paragraph 3, first subparagraph, or to modify them, \nonly where there is concrete and reliable evidence of the existence of AI systems that fall \nunder the scope of Annex III but do not pose a significant risk of harm to the health, \nsafety or fundamental rights of natural persons.\nThe Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 97 in order to \ndelete any of the conditions laid down in the paragraph 3, first subparagraph, where \nthere is concrete and reliable evidence that this is necessary for the purpose of \nmaintaining the level of protection of health, safety and fundamental rights in the \nUnion.\nAny amendment to the conditions laid down in paragraph 3, first subparagraph, shall \nnot decrease the overall level of protection of health, safety and fundamental rights in \nthe Union.\nWhen adopting the delegated acts, the Commission shall ensure consistency with the \ndelegated acts adopted pursuant to Article 7(1), and shall take account of market and \ntechnological developments.\nAmendments to annex iii\n\nArticle 7\nAmendments to Annex III\n1. The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 97 to amend Annex \nIII by adding or modifying use-cases of high-risk AI systems where both of the following \nconditions are fulfilled:\n(a) the AI systems are intended to be used in any of the areas listed in Annex III;\n(b) the AI systems pose a risk of harm to  health and safety, or an adverse impact on \nfundamental rights, and that risk is equivalent to, or greater than, the risk of harm or \nof adverse impact posed by the high-risk AI systems already referred to in Annex III.\n2. When assessing the condition under paragraph 1, point (b),, the Commission shall take into \naccount the following criteria:\n(a) the intended purpose of the AI system;\n(b) the extent to which an AI system has been used or is likely to be used;\n(c) the nature and amount of the data processed and used by the AI system, in \nparticular whether special categories of personal data are processed;\n(d) the extent to which the AI system acts autonomously and the possibility for a \nhuman to override a decision or recommendations that may lead to potential harm;\n(e) the extent to which the use of an AI system has already caused harm to  health and \nsafety, has had an adverse impact on  fundamental rights or has given rise to \nsignificant concerns in relation to the likelihood of such harm or adverse impact, as \ndemonstrated, for example, by reports or documented allegations submitted to \nnational competent authorities or by other reports, as appropriate;\n(f) the potential extent of such harm or such adverse impact, in particular in terms of its \nintensity and its ability to affect multiple persons or to disproportionately affect a \nparticular group of persons;\n(g) the extent to which persons who are potentially harmed or suffer an adverse impact \nare dependent on the outcome produced with an AI system, in particular because for \npractical or legal reasons it is not reasonably possible to opt-out from that outcome;\n(h) the extent to which there is an imbalance of power, or the persons who are \npotentially harmed or suffer an adverse impact are in a vulnerable position in relation \nto the deployer of an AI system, in particular due to status, authority, knowledge, \neconomic or social circumstances, or age;\n(i) the extent to which the outcome produced involving an AI system is easily corrigible \nor reversible, taking into account the technical solutions available to correct or \nreverse it, whereby outcomes having an adverse impact on  health, safety or \nfundamental rights, shall not be considered to be easily corrigible or reversible;\n(j) the magnitude and likelihood of benefit of the deployment of the AI system for \nindividuals, groups, or society at large, including possible improvements in product \nsafety;\n(k) the extent to which existing Union law provides for:\n(i) effective measures of redress in relation to the risks posed by an AI system, \nwith the exclusion of claims for damages;\n(ii) effective measures to prevent or substantially minimise those risks.\n3. The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 97 to amend the \nlist in Annex III by removing high-risk AI systems where both of the following \nconditions are fulfilled:\n(a) the high-risk AI system concerned no longer poses any significant risks to \nfundamental rights, health or safety, taking into account the criteria listed in \nparagraph 2;\n(b) the deletion does not decrease the overall level of protection of health, safety and \nfundamental rights under Union law.\nSection 2\nRequirements for high-risk AI systems\nCompliance with the requirements\n\nArticle 8\nCompliance with the requirements\n1. High-risk AI systems shall comply with the requirements laid down in this Section, taking \ninto account their intended purposes as well as the generally acknowledged state of the \nart on AI and AI-related technologies. The risk management system referred to in \nArticle 9 shall be taken into account when ensuring compliance with those \nrequirements.\n2. Where a product contains an AI system, to which the requirements of this Regulation as \nwell as requirements of the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Section A of Annex \nI apply, providers shall be responsible for ensuring that their product is fully compliant \nwith all applicable requirements required under applicable Union harmonisation \nlegislation. In ensuring the compliance of high-risk AI systems referred to in paragraph\n1 with the requirements set out in this Section, and in order to ensure consistency, avoid \nduplications and minimise additional burdens, providers shall have a choice of \nintegrating, as appropriate, the necessary testing and reporting processes, information \nand documentation they provide with regard to their product into documentation and \nprocedures that already exist and are required under the Union harmonisation \nlegislation listed in Section A of Annex I,.\nRisk management system\n\nArticle 9\nRisk management system\n1. A risk management system shall be established, implemented, documented and maintained \nin relation to high-risk AI systems.\n2. The risk management system shall be understood as a continuous iterative process \nplanned and run throughout the entire lifecycle of a high-risk AI system, requiring regular \nsystematic review and updating. It shall comprise the following steps:\n(a) the identification and analysis of the known and the reasonably foreseeable risks \nthat the high-risk AI system can pose to health, safety or fundamental rights when \nthe high-risk AI system is used in accordance with its intended purpose;\n(b) the estimation and evaluation of the risks that may emerge when the high-risk AI \nsystem is used in accordance with its intended purpose, and under conditions of \nreasonably foreseeable misuse;\n(c) the evaluation of other risks possibly arising, based on the analysis of data gathered \nfrom the post-market monitoring system referred to in Article 72;\n(d) the adoption of appropriate and targeted risk management measures designed to \naddress the risks identified pursuant to point (a) .\n3. The risks referred to in this Article shall concern only those which may be reasonably \nmitigated or eliminated through the development or design of the high-risk AI system, or \nthe provision of adequate technical information.\n4. The risk management measures referred to in paragraph 2, point (d), shall give due \nconsideration to the effects and possible interaction resulting from the combined \napplication of the requirements set out in this Section, with a view to minimising risks \nmore effectively while achieving an appropriate balance in implementing the measures \nto fulfil those requirements.\n5. The risk management measures referred to in paragraph 2, point (d), shall be such that the \nrelevant residual risk associated with each hazard, as well as the overall residual risk of the \nhigh-risk AI systems is judged to be acceptable.\nIn identifying the most appropriate risk management measures, the following shall be \nensured:\n(a) elimination or reduction of identified and evaluated risks pursuant to paragraph 2 \nas far as technically feasible through adequate design and development of the high-\nrisk AI system;\n(b) where appropriate, implementation of adequate mitigation and control measures \naddressing risks that cannot be eliminated;\n(c) provision of information required pursuant to Article 13 and, where appropriate, \ntraining to deployers. \nWith a view to eliminating or reducing risks related to the use of the high-risk AI system, \ndue consideration shall be given to the technical knowledge, experience, education, the \ntraining to be expected by the deployer, and the presumable context in which the system is \nintended to be used.\n6. High-risk AI systems shall be tested for the purpose of identifying the most appropriate \nand targeted risk management measures. Testing shall ensure that high-risk AI systems \nperform consistently for their intended purpose and that they are in compliance with the \nrequirements set out in this Section.\n7. Testing procedures may include testing in real-world conditions in accordance with \nArticle 60.\n8. The testing of high-risk AI systems shall be performed, as appropriate, at any time \nthroughout the development process, and, in any event, prior to their being placed on the \nmarket or put into service. Testing shall be carried out against prior defined metrics and \nprobabilistic thresholds that are appropriate to the intended purpose of the high-risk AI \nsystem.\n9. When implementing the risk management system as provided for in paragraphs 1 to 7, \nproviders shall give consideration to whether in view of its intended purpose the high-risk \nAI system is likely to have an adverse impact on persons under the age of 18 and, as \nappropriate, other groups of vulnerable persons.\n10. For providers of high-risk AI systems that are subject to requirements regarding internal \nrisk management processes under other relevant provisions of Union law, the aspects \nprovided in paragraphs 1 to 9 may be part of, or combined with, the risk management \nprocedures established  pursuant to that law.\nData and data governance\n\nArticle 10\nData and data governance\n1. High-risk AI systems which make use of techniques involving the training of AI models \nwith data shall be developed on the basis of training, validation and testing data sets that \nmeet the quality criteria referred to in paragraphs 2 to 5 whenever such data sets are used.\n2. Training, validation and testing data sets shall be subject to data governance and \nmanagement practices appropriate for the intended purpose of the high-risk AI system. \nThose practices shall concern in particular:\n(a) the relevant design choices;\n(b) data collection processes and the origin of data, and in the case of personal data, \nthe original purpose of the data collection;\n(c) relevant data-preparation processing operations, such as annotation, labelling, \ncleaning, updating, enrichment and aggregation;\n(d) the formulation of  assumptions, in particular with respect to the information that \nthe data are supposed to measure and represent;\n(e) an assessment of the availability, quantity and suitability of the data sets that are \nneeded;\n(f) examination in view of possible biases that are likely to affect the health and safety \nof persons, have a negative impact on fundamental rights or lead to discrimination \nprohibited under Union law, especially where data outputs influence inputs for \nfuture operations;\n(g) appropriate measures to detect, prevent and mitigate possible biases identified \naccording to point (f);\n(h) the identification of relevant data gaps or shortcomings that prevent compliance \nwith this Regulation, and how those gaps and shortcomings can be addressed.\n3. Training, validation and testing data sets shall be relevant, sufficiently representative, and \nto the best extent possible, free of errors and complete in view of the intended purpose. \nThey shall have the appropriate statistical properties, including, where applicable, as \nregards the persons or groups of persons in relation to whom the high-risk AI system is \nintended to be used. Those characteristics of the data sets may be met at the level of \nindividual data sets or at the level of a combination thereof.\n4. Data sets shall take into account, to the extent required by the intended purpose, the \ncharacteristics or elements that are particular to the specific geographical, contextual, \nbehavioural or functional setting within which the high-risk AI system is intended to be \nused.\n5. To the extent that it is strictly necessary for the purpose of ensuring bias  detection and \ncorrection in relation to the high-risk AI systems in accordance with paragraph (2), points\n(f) and (g) of this Article, the providers of such systems may exceptionally process special \ncategories of personal data, subject to appropriate safeguards for the fundamental rights \nand freedoms of natural persons. In addition to the provisions set out in Regulation (EU) \n2016/679, Directive (EU) 2016/680 and Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, all the following \nconditions shall apply in order for such processing to occur:\n(a) the bias detection and correction cannot be effectively fulfilled by processing other \ndata, including synthetic or anonymised data;\n(b) the special categories of personal data are subject to technical limitations on the \nre-use of the personal data, and state of the art security and privacy-preserving \nmeasures, including pseudonymisation;\n(c) the special categories of personal data are subject to measures to ensure that the \npersonal data processed are secured, protected, subject to suitable safeguards, \nincluding strict controls and documentation of the access, to avoid misuse and \nensure that only authorised persons with appropriate confidentiality obligations \nhave access to those personal data;\n(d) the personal data in the special categories of personal data are not to be \ntransmitted, transferred or otherwise accessed by other parties;\n(e) the personal data in the special categories of personal data are deleted once the \nbias has been corrected or the personal data has reached the end of its retention \nperiod, whichever comes first;\n(f) the records of processing activities pursuant to Regulations (EU) 2016/679 and \n(EU) 2018/1725 and Directive (EU) 2016/680include the reasons why the \nprocessing of special categories of personal data was strictly necessary to detect \nand correct biases, and why that objective could not be achieved by processing \nother data.\n6. For the development of high-risk AI systems not using techniques involving the training \nof AI models, paragraphs 2 to 5 apply only to the testing data sets.\nTechnical documentation\n\nArticle 11\nTechnical documentation\n1. The technical documentation of a high-risk AI system shall be drawn up before that system \nis placed on the market or put into service and shall be kept up-to date.\nThe technical documentation shall be drawn up in such a way as to demonstrate that the \nhigh-risk AI system complies with the requirements set out in this Section and to provide \nnational competent authorities and notified bodies with the necessary information in a \nclear and comprehensive form to assess the compliance of the AI system with those \nrequirements. It shall contain, at a minimum, the elements set out in Annex IV. SMEs, \nincluding start-ups, may provide the elements of the technical documentation specified \nin Annex IV in a simplified manner. For this purpose, the Commission shall establish a \nsimplified technical documentation form targeted at the needs of small and \nmicroenterprises. Where an SME, including a start-up, opts to provide the information \nrequired in Annex IV in a simplified manner, it shall use the form referred to in this \nparagraph. Notified bodies shall accept the form for the purposes of the conformity \nassessment.\n2. Where a high-risk AI system related to a product covered by the Union harmonisation \nlegislation listed in Section A of Annex I is placed on the market or put into service, a \nsingle set of technical documentation shall be drawn up containing all the information set \nout in paragraph 1, as well as the information required under those legal acts.\n3. The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 97 to amend Annex \nIV where necessary to ensure that, in the light of technical progress, the technical \ndocumentation provides all the information necessary to assess the compliance of the \nsystem with the requirements set out in this Section.\nRecord-keeping\n\nArticle 12\nRecord-keeping\n1. High-risk AI systems shall technically allow for the automatic recording of events (‘logs’) \nover their lifetime.\n2. In order to ensure a level of traceability of the functioning of a high-risk AI system  that \nis appropriate to the intended purpose of the system, logging capabilities shall enable the \nrecording of events relevant for:\n(a) identifying situations that may result in the high-risk AI system presenting a risk \nwithin the meaning of Article 79(1) or in a substantial modification;\n(b) facilitating the post-market monitoring referred to in Article 72; and\n(c) monitoring the operation of high-risk AI systems referred to in Article 26(6).\n3. For high-risk AI systems referred to in point 1 (a) of Annex III, the logging capabilities \nshall provide, at a minimum:\n(a) recording of the period of each use of the system (start date and time and end date \nand time of each use);\n(b) the reference database against which input data has been checked by the system;\n(c) the input data for which the search has led to a match;\n(d) the identification of the natural persons involved in the verification of the results, as \nreferred to in Article 14(5).\nTransparency and provision of information to deployers\n\nArticle 13\nTransparency and provision of information to deployers\n1. High-risk AI systems shall be designed and developed in such a way as to ensure that their \noperation is sufficiently transparent to enable deployers to interpret a system’s output and \nuse it appropriately. An appropriate type and degree of transparency shall be ensured  \nwith a view to achieving compliance with the relevant obligations of the provider and \ndeployer set out in Section 3.\n2. High-risk AI systems shall be accompanied by instructions for use in an appropriate digital \nformat or otherwise that include concise, complete, correct and clear information that is \nrelevant, accessible and comprehensible to deployers.\n3. The instructions for use shall contain at least the following information:\n(a) the identity and the contact details of the provider and, where applicable, of its \nauthorised representative;\n(b) the characteristics, capabilities and limitations of performance of the high-risk AI \nsystem, including:\n(i) its intended purpose;\n(ii) the level of accuracy, including its metrics, robustness and

High-risk AI systems shall be designed and developed in such a way, including with \nappropriate human-machine interface tools, that they can be effectively overseen by natural \npersons during the period in which they are in use.\n2. Human oversight shall aim to prevent or minimise the risks to health, safety or \nfundamental rights that may emerge when a high-risk AI system is used in accordance with \nits intended purpose or under conditions of reasonably foreseeable misuse, in particular \nwhere such risks persist despite the application of other requirements set out in this \nSection.\n3. The oversight measures shall be commensurate to the risks, level of autonomy and \ncontext of use of the high-risk AI system, and shall be ensured through either one or both \nof the following types of measures:\n(a) measures identified and built, when technically feasible, into the high-risk AI system \nby the provider before it is placed on the market or put into service;\n(b) measures identified by the provider before placing the high-risk AI system on the \nmarket or putting it into service and that are appropriate to be implemented by the \ndeployer.\n4. For the purpose of implementing paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, the high-risk AI system shall be \nprovided to the user in such a way that natural persons to whom human oversight is \nassigned are enabled, as appropriate and proportionate to the following circumstances:\n(a) to properly understand the relevant capacities and limitations of the high-risk AI \nsystem and be able to duly monitor its operation, including in view of detecting and \naddressing anomalies, dysfunctions and unexpected performance ;\n(b) to remain aware of the possible tendency of automatically relying or over-relying on \nthe output produced by a high-risk AI system (‘automation bias’), in particular for \nhigh-risk AI systems used to provide information or recommendations for decisions \nto be taken by natural persons;\n(c)  to correctly interpret the high-risk AI system’s output, taking into account, for \nexample, the interpretation tools and methods available;\n(d)  to decide, in any particular situation, not to use the high-risk AI system or to \notherwise disregard, override or reverse the output of the high-risk AI system;\n(e)  to intervene in the operation of the high-risk AI system or interrupt the system \nthrough a ‘stop’ button or a similar procedure that allows the system to come to a \nhalt in a safe state.\n5. For high-risk AI systems referred to in point 1(a) of Annex III, the measures referred to in \nparagraph 3 of this Article shall be such as to ensure that, in addition, no action or decision \nis taken by the deployer on the basis of the identification resulting from the system unless \nthat identification has been separately verified and confirmed by at least two natural \npersons with the necessary competence, training and authority.\nThe requirement for a separate verification by at least two natural persons shall not \napply to high-risk AI systems used for the purposes of law enforcement, migration, \nborder control or asylum, where Union or national law considers the application of this \nrequirement to be disproportionate.\nAccuracy, robustness and cybersecurity\n\nArticle 15\nAccuracy, robustness and cybersecurity\n1. High-risk AI systems shall be designed and developed in such a way that they achieve  \nan appropriate level of accuracy, robustness, and cybersecurity, and that they perform \nconsistently in those respects throughout their lifecycle.\n2. To address the technical aspects of how to measure the appropriate levels of accuracy \nand robustness set out in paragraph 1 and any other relevant performance metrics, the \nCommission shall, in cooperation with relevant stakeholder and organisations such as \nmetrology and benchmarking authorities, encourage, as appropriate, the development of \nbenchmarks and measurement methodologies.\n3. The levels of accuracy and the relevant accuracy metrics of high-risk AI systems shall be \ndeclared in the accompanying instructions of use.\n4. High-risk AI systems shall be as resilient as possible regarding errors, faults or \ninconsistencies that may occur within the system or the environment in which the system \noperates, in particular due to their interaction with natural persons or other systems. \nTechnical and organisational measures shall be taken towards this regard.\nThe robustness of high-risk AI systems may be achieved through technical redundancy \nsolutions, which may include backup or fail-safe plans.\nHigh-risk AI systems that continue to learn after being placed on the market or put into \nservice shall be developed in such a way as to eliminate or reduce as far as possible the \nrisk of possibly biased outputs influencing input for future operations (‘feedback loops’), \nand as to ensure that any such feedback loops are duly addressed with appropriate \nmitigation measures.\n5.

For high-risk AI systems listed in point 1 of Annex III, where, in demonstrating the \ncompliance of a high-risk AI system with the requirements set out in Section 2, the \nprovider has applied harmonised standards referred to in Article 40, or, where applicable, \ncommon specifications referred to in Article 41, the provider shall opt for one of the \nfollowing conformity assessment procedures based on:\n(a) the internal control referred to in Annex VI; or\n(b) the assessment of the quality management system and the assessment of the technical \ndocumentation, with the involvement of a notified body, referred to in Annex VII.\nIn demonstrating the compliance of a high-risk AI system with the requirements set out \nin Section 2, the provider shall follow the conformity assessment procedure set out in \nAnnex VII where:\n(a) harmonised standards referred to in Article 40  do not exist, and common \nspecifications referred to in Article 41 are not available;\n(b) the provider has not applied, or has applied only part of, the harmonised standard;\n(c) the common specifications referred to in point (a) exist, but the provider has not \napplied them;\n(d) one or more of the harmonised standards referred to in point (a) has been \npublished with a restriction, and only on the part of the standard that was \nrestricted.\nFor the purposes of the conformity assessment procedure referred to in Annex VII, the \nprovider may choose any of the notified bodies. However, where the high-risk AI system is \nintended to be put into service by law enforcement, immigration or asylum authorities or \nby Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, the market surveillance authority \nreferred to in Article 74(8) or (9), as applicable, shall act as a notified body.\n2. For high-risk AI systems referred to in points 2 to 8 of Annex III,  providers shall follow \nthe conformity assessment procedure based on internal control as referred to in Annex VI, \nwhich does not provide for the involvement of a notified body.\n3. For high-risk AI systems covered by the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Section \nA of Annex I,,, the provider shall follow the relevant conformity assessment procedure as \nrequired under those legal acts. The requirements set out in Section 2 of this Chapter shall \napply to those high-risk AI systems and shall be part of that assessment. Points 4.3., 4.4., \n4.5. and the fifth paragraph of point 4.6 of Annex VII shall also apply.\nFor the purposes of that assessment, notified bodies which have been notified under those \nlegal acts shall be entitled to control the conformity of the high-risk AI systems with the \nrequirements set out in Section 2, provided that the compliance of those notified bodies \nwith requirements laid down in Article 31(4), (10) and (11) has been assessed in the \ncontext of the notification procedure under those legal acts.\nWhere a legal act listed in section A of Annex I enables the product manufacturer to opt \nout from a third-party conformity assessment, provided that that manufacturer has applied \nall harmonised standards covering all the relevant requirements, that manufacturer may use \nthat option only if it has also applied harmonised standards or, where applicable, common \nspecifications referred to in Article 41, covering the requirements set out in Section 2 of \nthis Chapter.\n4. High-risk AI systems that have already been subject to a conformity assessment \nprocedure shall undergo a new conformity assessment procedure in the event of a \nsubstantial modification, regardless of whether the modified system is intended to be \nfurther distributed or continues to be used by the current deployer.\nFor high-risk AI systems that continue to learn after being placed on the market or put into \nservice, changes to the high-risk AI system and its performance that have been pre-\ndetermined by the provider at the moment of the initial conformity assessment and are part \nof the information contained in the technical documentation referred to in point 2(f) of \nAnnex IV, shall not constitute a substantial modification.\n5. The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 97 to update \nAnnexes VI and VII in  light of technical progress.\n6. The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 97 amending \nparagraphs 1 and 2 of this Article in order to subject high-risk AI systems referred to in \npoints 2 to 8 of Annex III to the conformity assessment procedure referred to in Annex VII \nor parts thereof. The Commission shall adopt such delegated acts taking into account the \neffectiveness of the conformity assessment procedure based on internal control referred to \nin Annex VI in preventing or minimising the risks to health and safety and protection of \nfundamental rights posed by such systems, as well as the availability of adequate capacities \nand resources among notified bodies.\nCertificates\n\nArticle 44\nCertificates\n1.

On \nthe application of the provider, the validity of a certificate may be extended for further \nperiods, each not exceeding five years for AI systems covered by Annex I, and four years \nfor AI systems covered by Annex III, based on a re-assessment in accordance with the \napplicable conformity assessment procedures. Any supplement to a certificate shall \nremain valid, provided that the certificate which it supplements is valid.\n3. Where a notified body finds that an AI system no longer meets the requirements set out in \nSection 2, it shall, taking account of the principle of proportionality, suspend or withdraw \nthe certificate issued or impose restrictions on it, unless compliance with those \nrequirements is ensured by appropriate corrective action taken by the provider of the \nsystem within an appropriate deadline set by the notified body. The notified body shall \ngive reasons for its decision.\nAn appeal procedure against decisions of the notified bodies, including against \nconformity certificates issued, shall be available.\nInformation obligations of notified bodies\n\nArticle 45\nInformation obligations of notified bodies\n1. Notified bodies shall inform the notifying authority of the following:\n(a) any Union technical documentation assessment certificates, any supplements to those \ncertificates, and any quality management system approvals issued in accordance with \nthe requirements of Annex VII;\n(b) any refusal, restriction, suspension or withdrawal of a Union technical \ndocumentation assessment certificate or a quality management system approval \nissued in accordance with the requirements of Annex VII;\n(c) any circumstances affecting the scope of or conditions for notification;\n(d) any request for information which they have received from market surveillance \nauthorities regarding conformity assessment activities;\n(e) on request, conformity assessment activities performed within the scope of their \nnotification and any other activity performed, including cross-border activities and \nsubcontracting.\n2. Each notified body shall inform the other notified bodies of:\n(a) quality management system approvals which it has refused, suspended or withdrawn, \nand, upon request, of quality system approvals which it has issued;\n(b) Union technical documentation assessment certificates or any supplements thereto \nwhich it has refused, withdrawn, suspended or otherwise restricted, and, upon \nrequest, of the certificates and/or supplements thereto which it has issued.\n3. Each notified body shall provide the other notified bodies carrying out similar conformity \nassessment activities covering the same types of AI systems with relevant information on \nissues relating to negative and, on request, positive conformity assessment results.\n4. The obligations referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this Article shall be complied \nwith in accordance with Article 78.\nDerogation from conformity assessment procedure\n\nArticle 46\nDerogation from conformity assessment procedure\n1. By way of derogation from Article 43 and upon a duly justified request, any market \nsurveillance authority may authorise the placing on the market or the putting into service of \nspecific high-risk AI systems within the territory of the Member State concerned, for \nexceptional reasons of public security or the protection of life and health of persons, \nenvironmental protection or the protection of key industrial and infrastructural assets. That \nauthorisation shall be for a limited period  while the necessary conformity assessment \nprocedures are being carried out, taking into account the exceptional reasons justifying \nthe derogation. The completion of those procedures shall be undertaken without undue \ndelay.\n2. In a duly justified situation of urgency for exceptional reasons of public security or in \nthe case of specific, substantial and imminent threat to the life or physical safety of \nnatural persons, law-enforcement authorities or civil protection authorities may put a \nspecific high-risk AI system into service without the authorisation referred to in \nparagraph 1, provided that such authorisation is requested during or after the use \nwithout undue delay. If the authorisation referred to in paragraph 1 is refused, the use \nof the high-risk AI system shall be stopped with immediate effect and all the results and \noutputs of such use shall be immediately discarded.\n3. The authorisation referred to in paragraph 1 shall be issued only if the market surveillance \nauthority concludes that the high-risk AI system complies with the requirements of Section\n2. The market surveillance authority shall inform the Commission and the other Member \nStates of any authorisation issued pursuant to paragraph 1. This obligation shall not cover \nsensitive operational data in relation to the activities of law-enforcement authorities.\n4. Where, within 15 calendar days of receipt of the information referred to in paragraph 3, no \nobjection has been raised by either a Member State or the Commission in respect of an \nauthorisation issued by a market surveillance authority of a Member State in accordance \nwith paragraph 1, that authorisation shall be deemed justified.\n5. Where, within 15 calendar days of receipt of the notification referred to in paragraph 3, \nobjections are raised by a Member State against an authorisation issued by a market \nsurveillance authority of another Member State, or where the Commission considers the \nauthorisation to be contrary to Union law, or the conclusion of the Member States \nregarding the compliance of the system as referred to in paragraph 3 to be unfounded, the \nCommission shall, without delay, enter into consultations with the relevant Member State. \nThe operators concerned shall be consulted and have the possibility to present their views. \nHaving regard thereto, the Commission shall decide whether the authorisation is justified. \nThe Commission shall address its decision to the Member State concerned and to the \nrelevant operators.\n6. Where the Commission considers the authorisation unjustified, it shall be withdrawn by the \nmarket surveillance authority of the Member State concerned.\n7.

Providers shall ensure that AI systems intended to interact directly with natural persons are \ndesigned and developed in such a way that the natural persons concerned are informed that \nthey are interacting with an AI system, unless this is obvious from the point of view of a \nnatural person who is reasonably well-informed, observant and circumspect, taking into \naccount the circumstances and the context of use. This obligation shall not apply to AI \nsystems authorised by law to detect, prevent, investigate or prosecute criminal offences, \nsubject to appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of third parties, unless \nthose systems are available for the public to report a criminal offence.\n2. Providers of AI systems, including general-purpose AI systems, generating synthetic \naudio, image, video or text content, shall ensure that the outputs of the AI system are \nmarked in a machine-readable format and detectable as artificially generated or \nmanipulated. Providers shall ensure their technical solutions are effective, interoperable, \nrobust and reliable as far as this is technically feasible, taking into account the \nspecificities and limitations of various types of content, the costs of implementation and \nthe generally acknowledged state-of-the-art, as may be reflected in relevant technical \nstandards. This obligation shall not apply to the extent the AI systems perform an \nassistive function for standard editing or do not substantially alter the input data \nprovided by the deployer or the semantics thereof, or where authorised by law to detect, \nprevent, investigate or prosecute criminal offences.\n3. Deployers of an emotion recognition system or a biometric categorisation system shall \ninform the natural persons exposed thereto of the operation of the system, and shall \nprocess the personal data in accordance with Regulations (EU) 2016/679 and (EU) \n2018/1725 and Directive (EU) 2016/680, as applicable. This obligation shall not apply to \nAI systems used for biometric categorisation and emotion recognition, which are \npermitted by law to detect, prevent or investigate criminal offences, subject to appropriate \nsafeguards for the rights and freedoms of third parties, and in compliance with Union \nlaw.\n4. Deployers of an AI system that generates or manipulates image, audio or video content \nconstituting a deep fake, shall disclose that the content has been artificially generated or \nmanipulated. This obligation shall not apply where the use is authorised by law to detect, \nprevent, investigate or prosecute criminal offence. Where the content forms part of an \nevidently artistic, creative, satirical, fictional analogous work or programme, the \ntransparency obligations set out in this paragraph are limited to disclosure of the \nexistence of such generated or manipulated content in an appropriate manner that does \nnot hamper the display or enjoyment of the work.\nDeployers of an AI system that generates or manipulates text which is published with the \npurpose of informing the public on matters of public interest shall disclose that the text \nhas been artificially generated or manipulated. This obligation shall not apply where the \nuse is authorised by law to detect, prevent, investigate or prosecute criminal offences or \nwhere the AI-generated content has undergone a process of human review or editorial \ncontrol and where a natural or legal person holds editorial responsibility for the \npublication of the content.\n5. The information referred to in paragraphs 1 to 4 shall be provided to the natural persons \nconcerned in a clear and distinguishable manner at the latest at the time of the first \ninteraction or exposure. The information shall conform to the applicable accessibility \nrequirements.\n6. Paragraphs 1 to 4 shall not affect the requirements and obligations set out in Chapter III, \nand shall be without prejudice to other transparency obligations laid down in Union or \nnational law for deployers of AI systems.\n7. The AI Office shall encourage and facilitate the drawing up of codes of practice at \nUnion level to facilitate the effective implementation of the obligations regarding the \ndetection and labelling of artificially generated or manipulated content. The \nCommission is empowered to adopt implementing acts to approve those codes of practice \nin accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 56 (6), (7) and (8). If it deems the \ncode is not adequate, the Commission is empowered to adopt an implementing act \nspecifying common rules for the implementation of those obligations in accordance with \nthe examination procedure laid down in Article 98(2).\nGeneral-purpose ai models\r\n\nClassification of general-purpose ai models as general-purpose ai models with systemic risk\n\nArticle 51\nClassification of general-purpose AI models as general-purpose AI models with systemic risk\n1. A general-purpose AI model shall be classified as a general-purpose AI model with \nsystemic risk if it meets any of the following requirements:\n(a) it has high impact capabilities evaluated on the basis of appropriate technical tools \nand methodologies, including indicators and benchmarks;\n(b) based on a decision of the Commission, ex officio or following a qualified alert \nfrom the scientific panel, it has capabilities or an impact equivalent to those set out \nin point (a) having regard to the criteria set out in Annex XIII.\n2. A general-purpose AI model shall be presumed to have high impact capabilities \npursuant to paragraph 1, point (a), when the cumulative amount of computation used \nfor its training measured in FLOPs is greater than 10^25.\n3. The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 97 to amend the \nthresholds listed in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, as well as to supplement \nbenchmarks and indicators in light of evolving technological developments, such as \nalgorithmic improvements or increased hardware efficiency, when necessary, for these \nthresholds to reflect the state of the art.\nProcedure\n\nArticle 52\nProcedure\n1. Where a general-purpose AI model meets the requirement referred to in Article 51(1), \npoint (a), the relevant provider shall notify the Commission without delay and in any \nevent within two weeks after that requirement is met or it becomes known that it will be \nmet. That notification shall include the information necessary to demonstrate that the \nrelevant requirement has been met. If the Commission becomes aware of a general-\npurpose AI model presenting systemic risks of which it has not been notified, it may \ndecide to designate it as a model with systemic risk.\n2. The provider of a general purpose AI model that meets the requirement referred to in \nArticle 51(1), point (a), may present, with its notification, sufficiently substantiated \narguments to demonstrate that, exceptionally, although it meets that requirement, the \ngeneral purpose AI model does not present, due to its specific characteristics, systemic \nrisks and therefore should not be classified as a general-purpose AI model with systemic \nrisk.\n3. Where the Commission concludes that the arguments submitted pursuant to paragraph 2 \nare not sufficiently substantiated and the relevant provider was not able to demonstrate \nthat the general-purpose AI model does not present, due to its specific characteristics, \nsystemic risks, it shall reject those arguments, and the general-purpose AI model shall be \nconsidered to be a general-purpose AI model with systemic risk.\n4. The Commission may designate a general-purpose AI model as presenting systemic \nrisks, ex officio or following a qualified alert from the scientific panel pursuant to \nArticle 90(1), point (a), on the basis of criteria set out in Annex XIII. \nThe Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 97 to specify and \nupdate the criteria set out in Annex XIII.\n5. Upon a reasoned request of a provider whose model has been designated as a general-\npurpose AI model with systemic risk pursuant to paragraph 4, the Commission shall take \nthe request into account and may decide to reassess whether the general-purpose AI \nmodel can still be considered to present systemic risks on the basis of the criteria set out \nin Annex XIII. Such request shall contain objective, detailed and new reasons that have \narisen since the designation decision. Providers may request reassessment at the earliest \nsix months after the designation decision. Where the Commission, following its \nreassessment, decides to maintain the designation as a general-purpose AI model with \nsystemic risk, providers may request reassessment at the earliest six months after that \ndecision.\n6. The Commission shall ensure that a list of general-purpose AI models with systemic risk \nis published and shall keep that list up to date, without prejudice to the need to observe \nand protect intellectual property rights and confidential business information or trade \nsecrets in accordance with Union and national law.\nSection 2\nObligations for providers of general-purpose AI models\nObligations for providers of general-purpose ai models\n\nArticle 53\nObligations for providers of general-purpose AI models\n1.

The mandate shall empower the authorised representative to be addressed, in addition to \nor instead of the provider, by the AI Office or the national competent authorities, on all \nissues related to ensuring compliance with this Regulation.\n4. The authorised representative shall terminate the mandate if it considers or has reason \nto consider the provider to be acting contrary to its obligations pursuant to this \nRegulation. In such a case, it shall also immediately inform the AI Office about the \ntermination of the mandate and the reasons therefor.\n5. The obligation set out in this Article shall not apply to providers of general-purpose AI \nmodels that are released under a free and open source licence that allows for the access, \nusage, modification, and distribution of the model, and whose parameters, including the \nweights, the information on the model architecture, and the information on model \nusage, are made publicly available, unless the general-purpose AI models present \nsystemic risks.\nSection 3\nObligations for providers of general-purpose AI models\n with systemic risk\nObligations for providers of general-purpose ai models with systemic risk\n\nArticle 55\nObligations for providers of general-purpose AI models with systemic risk\n1. In addition to the obligations listed in Article 53, providers of general-purpose AI models \nwith systemic risk shall:\n(a) perform model evaluation in accordance with standardised protocols and tools \nreflecting the state-of-the-art, including conducting and documenting adversarial \ntesting of the model with a view to identifying and mitigating systemic risk;\n(b) assess and mitigate possible systemic risks at Union level, including their sources, \nthat may stem from the development, the placing on the market, or the use of \ngeneral-purpose AI models with systemic risk;\n(c) keep track of, document and report without undue delay to the AI Office and, as \nappropriate, to national competent authorities, relevant information about serious \nincidents and possible corrective measures to address them;\n(d) ensure an adequate level of cybersecurity protection for the general-purpose AI \nmodel with systemic risk and the physical infrastructure of the model.\n2. Providers of general-purpose AI models with systemic risk may rely on codes of practice \nwithin the meaning of Article 56 to demonstrate compliance with the obligations set out \nin paragraph 1 of this Article, until a harmonised standard is published. Providers who \nare in compliance with a European harmonised standard shall be presumed to be in \ncompliance with the obligations set out in paragraph 1 of this Article. Providers of \ngeneral-purpose AI models with systemic risks who do not adhere to an approved code of \npractice shall demonstrate alternative adequate means of compliance for approval by the \nCommission.\n3. Any information or documentation obtained pursuant to this Article, including trade \nsecrets, shall be treated in compliance with the confidentiality obligations set out in \nArticle 78.\nCodes of practice\n\nArticle 56\nCodes of practice\n1. The AI Office shall encourage and facilitate the drawing up of codes of practice at \nUnion level in order to contribute to the proper application of this Regulation, taking \ninto account international approaches.\n2. The AI Office and the Board shall aim to ensure that the codes of practice cover at least \nthe obligations provided for in Articles 53 and 55, including the following issues:\n(a) means to ensure that the information referred to in Article 53(1), points (a) and (b), \nis kept up to date in the light of market and technological developments;\n(b) the adequate level of detail for the summary about the content used for training;\n(c) the identification of the type and nature of the systemic risks at Union level, \nincluding their sources, where appropriate;\n(d) the measures, procedures and modalities for the assessment and management of \nthe systemic risks at Union level, including the documentation thereof, which shall \nbe proportionate to the risks, take into consideration their severity and probability \nand take into account the specific challenges of tackling those risks in the light of \nthe possible ways in which such risks may emerge and materialise along the AI \nvalue chain.\n3. The AI Office may invite all providers of general-purpose AI models, as well as relevant \nnational competent authorities, to participate in the drawing-up of codes of practice. \nCivil society organisations, industry, academia and other relevant stakeholders, such as \ndownstream providers and independent experts, may support the process.\n4. The AI Office and the Board shall aim to ensure that the codes of practice clearly set out \ntheir specific objectives and contain commitments or measures, including key \nperformance indicators as appropriate, to ensure the achievement of those objectives, \nand that they take due account of the needs and interests of all interested parties, \nincluding affected persons, at Union level.\n5. The AI Office shall aim to ensure that participants to the codes of practice report \nregularly to the AI Office on the implementation of the commitments and the measures \ntaken and their outcomes, including as measured against the key performance indicators \nas appropriate. Key performance indicators and reporting commitments shall reflect \ndifferences in size and capacity between various participants.\n6. The AI Office and the Board shall regularly monitor and evaluate the achievement of \nthe objectives of the codes of practice by the participants and their contribution to the \nproper application of this Regulation. The AI Office and the Board shall assess whether \nthe codes of practice cover the obligations provided for in Articles 53 and 55, as well as \nthe issues listed in paragraph 2 of this Article, and shall regularly monitor and evaluate \nthe achievement of their objectives. They shall publish their assessment of the adequacy \nof the codes of practice. \nThe Commission may, by way of an implementing act, approve a code of practice and \ngive it a general validity within the Union. That implementing act shall be adopted in \naccordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 98(2).\n7. The AI Office may invite all providers of general-purpose AI models to adhere to the \ncodes of practice. For providers of general-purpose AI models not presenting systemic \nrisks this adherence may be limited to the obligations provided for in Article 53, unless \nthey declare explicitly their interest to join the full code.\n8. The AI Office shall, as appropriate, also encourage and facilitate the review and \nadaptation of the codes of practice, in particular in the light of emerging standards. The \nAI Office shall assist in the assessment of available standards.\n9. Codes of practice shall be ready at the latest by … [nine months from the date of entry into \nforce of this Regulation]. The AI Office shall take the necessary steps, including inviting \nproviders pursuant to paragraph 7. \nIf, by ... [12 months from the date of entry into force], a code of practice cannot be \nfinalised, or if the AI Office deems it is not adequate following its assessment under \nparagraph 6 of this Article, the Commission may provide, by means of implementing \nacts, common rules for the implementation of the obligations provided for in Articles 53 \nand 55, including the issues set out in paragraph 2 of this Article. Those implementing \nacts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in \nArticle 98(2).\nMeasures in support of innovation\r\n\nAi regulatory sandboxes\n\nArticle 57\nAI regulatory sandboxes\n1. Member States shall ensure that their competent authorities establish at least one AI \nregulatory sandbox at national level, which shall be operational by … [24 months from \nthe date of entry into force of this Regulation]. That sandbox may also be established \njointly with the competent authorities of one or more other Member States. The \nCommission may provide technical support, advice and tools for the establishment and \noperation of AI regulatory sandboxes.\nThe obligation under the first subparagraph may also be fulfilled by participating in an \nexisting sandbox in so far as that participation provides an equivalent level of national \ncoverage for the participating Member States.\n2. Additional AI regulatory sandboxes at regional or local level, or established jointly with \nthe competent authorities of other Member States may also be established.\n3. The European Data Protection Supervisor may also establish an AI regulatory sandbox \nfor Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, and may exercise the roles and the \ntasks of national competent authorities in accordance with this Chapter.\n4. Member States shall ensure that the competent authorities referred to in paragraphs 1 \nand 2 allocate sufficient resources to comply with this Article effectively and in a timely \nmanner. Where appropriate, national competent authorities shall cooperate with other \nrelevant authorities, and may allow for the involvement of other actors within the AI \necosystem. This Article shall not affect other regulatory sandboxes established under \nUnion or national law. Member States shall ensure an appropriate level of cooperation \nbetween the authorities supervising those other sandboxes and the national competent \nauthorities.\n5. AI regulatory sandboxes established under paragraph (1) shall provide for a controlled \nenvironment that fosters innovation and facilitates the development, training, testing and \nvalidation of innovative AI systems for a limited time before their being placed on the \nmarket or put into service pursuant to a specific sandbox plan agreed between the \nprospective providers and the competent authority. Such regulatory sandboxes may \ninclude testing in real world conditions supervised in the sandbox.\n6. Competent authorities shall provide, as appropriate, guidance, supervision and support \nwithin the AI regulatory sandbox with a view to identifying risks, in particular to \nfundamental rights, health and safety, testing, mitigation measures, and their \neffectiveness in relation to the obligations and requirements of this Regulation and, \nwhere relevant, other Union and Member State law supervised within the sandbox.\n7. Competent authorities shall provide providers and prospective providers using the AI \nregulatory sandbox with guidance on regulatory expectations and how to fulfil the \nrequirements and obligations set out in this Regulation.\nUpon request of the provider or prospective provider of the AI system, the competent \nauthority shall provide a written proof of the activities successfully carried out in the \nsandbox. The competent authority shall also provide an exit report detailing the activities \ncarried out in the sandbox and the related results and learning outcomes. Providers may \nuse such documentation to demonstrate their compliance with this Regulation through \nthe conformity assessment process or relevant market surveillance activities. In this \nregard, the exit reports and the written proof provided by the national competent \nauthority shall be taken positively into account by market surveillance authorities and \nnotified bodies, with a view to accelerating conformity assessment procedures to a \nreasonable extent.\n8. Subject to the confidentiality provisions in Article 78, and with the agreement of the \nprovider or prospective provider, the Commission and the Board shall be authorised to \naccess the exit reports and shall take them into account, as appropriate, when exercising \ntheir tasks under this Regulation. If both the provider or prospective provider and the \nnational competent authority explicitly agree, the exit report may be made publicly \navailable through the single information platform referred to in this Article.\n9. The establishment of AI regulatory sandboxes shall aim to contribute to the following \nobjectives:\n(a) improving legal certainty to achieve regulatory compliance with this Regulation or, \nwhere relevant, other applicable Union and national law;\n(b) supporting the sharing of best practices through cooperation with the authorities \ninvolved in the AI regulatory sandbox;\n(c) fostering innovation and competitiveness and facilitating the development of an AI \necosystem;\n(d) contributing to evidence-based regulatory learning;\n(e) facilitating and accelerating access to the Union market for AI systems, in \nparticular when provided by SMEs, including start-ups.\n10. National competent authorities shall ensure that, to the extent the innovative AI systems \ninvolve the processing of personal data or otherwise fall under the supervisory remit of \nother national authorities or competent authorities providing or supporting access to data, \nthe national data protection authorities and those other national or competent authorities \nare associated with the operation of the AI regulatory sandbox and involved in the \nsupervision of those aspects to the extent of their respective tasks and powers.\n11. The AI regulatory sandboxes shall not affect the supervisory or corrective powers of the \ncompetent authorities supervising the sandboxes, including at regional or local level. Any \nsignificant risks to health and safety and fundamental rights identified during the \ndevelopment and testing of such AI systems shall result in an adequate mitigation. \nNational competent authorities shall have the power to temporarily or permanently \nsuspend the testing process, or the participation in the sandbox if no effective mitigation \nis possible, and shall inform the AI Office of such decision. National competent \nauthorities shall exercise their supervisory powers within the limits of the relevant law, \nusing their discretionary powers when implementing legal provisions in respect of a \nspecific AI sandbox project, with the objective of supporting innovation in AI in the \nUnion.\n12. Providers and prospective providers participating in the AI regulatory sandbox shall \nremain liable under applicable Union and national liability law for any damage inflicted on \nthird parties as a result of the experimentation taking place in the sandbox. However, \nprovided that the prospective providers observe the specific plan and the terms and \nconditions for their participation and follow in good faith the guidance given by the \nnational competent authority, no administrative fines shall be imposed by the authorities \nfor infringements of this Regulation. To the extent that other competent authorities \nresponsible for other Union and national law were actively involved in the supervision of \nthe AI system in the sandbox and provided guidance for compliance, no administrative \nfines shall be imposed regarding that law.\n13. The AI regulatory sandboxes shall be designed and implemented in such a way that, \nwhere relevant, they facilitate cross-border cooperation between national competent \nauthorities.\n14.
